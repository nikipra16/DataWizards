## What we intended?
Canvas discussions is a valuable tool to promote student interaction by engaging with the material through peer discussions. However, these discussions can be lengthy, like having huge paragraphs or multiple replies, creating a long discussion thread. This can be tiresome for the professor to read. Discussions are helpful for other students to read and learn, but this can be quite overwhelming and boring. 
Our project aims to turn those mundane text-heavy discussions into fun animations that make learning more enjoyable for everyoneâ€” students and professors alike.

## Future ideas
* Extending it to work with n amount of people in a discussion.
* Adding a GUI that allows the professor and student to choose the discussion to be played. 
* Add customizable features like text speed and dynamic animations.
* Hook up an llm to read each message and dynamically decide which animation is suitable, eg, desk slam for counter argument.
