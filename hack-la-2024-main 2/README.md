# 2024 Fall Learning Analytics Hackathon
Welcome to the 10th Learning Analytics hackathon. This year, the goal is for you to find creative ways to use Canvas discussion data to improve the teaching or learning experience. Imagine you had data that represented all of the discussion activity in a Canvas course ‚Äì what would you build?

## Before the Hackathon
* Please **[register](https://events.ctlt.ubc.ca/events/2024-fall-learning-analytics-hackathon/)** for the hackathon if you haven't ready done so.
* Find a team (we suggest at least 3 per team, with a **maximum of 5**) (you will sign up your team in Canvas once we send the enrolment link). Individual team members **should all register for the event!** 
* Review the challenge details, data, and other materials (to be provided in Canvas at least 2 weeks before the event).
* Some details are still being planned, and we will communicate after registration.

## üìÖ Schedule
### Saturday October 19th
* 9:00am - Doors open (Coffee and light refreshments provided)
* 9:30am to 10am - Welcome and Overview 
* 10am to Noon - Start Hacking
* 12pm to 1pm - Lunch (provided)
* 1pm to 4pm - Keep Hacking
* 4pm to 5pm - Work on presentations (Dinner provided!)
* 5pm - Presentations Start
* 7pm - End of Hackathon!

## üî® What You'll Build
The discussions in Canvas are rich with content that serve as a great data source for learning analytics, allowing educators, researchers, and intelligent hackathon participants to analyze student engagement, collaboration, sentiment, learning progress, among other factors to help improve teaching and learning. Your task is to build something that can be used to analyze and make sense of this discussion data. 

Feeling stuck? [Check out this past hackathon repo for more ideas!](https://github.com/UBC-LA-Hackathon/student-dashboard)

## üß∞ Where to Start
You can decide with your team what programming languages and frameworks/libraries to work with. If you need somewhere to get started with using the Canvas API, check out these two starter kits that we created: 
* [Getting Started with the Canvas API with Node.js/JavaScript](https://github.com/ubc/getting-started-with-the-canvas-api-with-node)
* [Getting Started with the Canvas API with Python](https://github.com/ubc/getting-started-with-the-canvas-api-with-python)

### üç¥ Fork this repo
To keep all of the repositories you'll be creating loosely linked to this repo, please: 

1. Fork this repo.
![fork](./_assets/fork.png)
1. Copy clone link.
![clone](./_assets/clone.png)
1. Open terminal on Mac or command line on Windows. We like to use [VSCode's integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal), as it works for both Mac and PC.
1. Clone repo. `git clone {paste URL you copied}`
1. Navigate into repo. `cd hack-la-2024`
1. Create your project in this repo.

## üìö What You'll Learn
By participating in this hackathon, you'll learn to:

* use the [Canvas API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/)
* explore the data that [Canvas collects from you](https://learninganalytics.ubc.ca/ethics-policy/students-learning-analytics-and-privacy/)
* contribute to [open source projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) (like this hackathon!)
* apply data analytics and programming skills
* work in a team
* build cool stuff!

## üöÄ "Submitting" and Presentations
This repo contains the file `submission.md`. Please fill this out including any links or additional information about your  project and presentation. You can add any project folders/files here too! 

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful to avoid committing: real data containing private information or intellectual property or Canvas API tokens!

When you're ready you can make a PR (which won't be merged!) so that we can find your content! 

1. From your fork once you've made all of your commits (including updating submissions.md) you can open a pull request
![open PR from fork](./_assets/openPR1.png)

2. Add a title and description (your team name and project description would be good here)
![add title and description](./_assets/openPR2.png)

**Note:** It is normal to see warnings "Review required" and "Merging is blocked" (we aren't going to be merging your PRs into the main repo).

3. If you return to the main repo https://github.com/UBC-LA-Hackathon/hack-la-2024 and look at Pull Requests, you can see your PR associated with the hack-la-2024 repo!
