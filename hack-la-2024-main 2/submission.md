# This Project
> Link to presentation:
> <br>Give a brief description of the final product: A project designed to take mundane Canvas discussions and turn them into engaging animations!

# Reflection
## Approach
> What was your approach to the dataset? What problem did you want to solve? What technology did you decide to use? How did your team split the work?
> <br><br>We used the sample json file provided as a basis for the information that could be extracted from Canvas. We wanted to make tedious and mundane discussions much more lively and engaging for students to read and interact with. We decided to use Python, specifically the library Selenium and JSON. We split the work evenly, working on different aspects of our project at the same time and using Git to deal with merge conflicts.

## Wins / Challenges
> Describe some wins / challenges. What did you learn? What would you do differently next time?
> <br><br>We successfully got the website to automatically begin an animated debate to do with one of the discussions provided about Banksy. The characters in the animation were dynamic and aimed to captivate the spectator and ensure they remember the information delivered. We learned to use Python to manipulate and use a website programmatically. This naturally extends to the skill of frontend testing, which uses the same library. If we had more time, we would have extended the project to work with any number of people in a discussion. We would have also added a GUI to make the tool more user-friendly and added customizable features such as text speed and more animations.
